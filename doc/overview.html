<h1>An overview of how Orchestra register works</h1>

<p>The basic idea is that you have some of players, and some events like
rehearsals and a concert, and you want to know which players are planning to be
at which events.</p>


<h2>Players</h2>

<p>As far as this system in concerned, payers have an first name, last name,
email address, and the part (instrument) they play. parts are further divided
into sections like strings or woodwind. The list of available parts and sections,
and the order in which they should be displayed, can be set when the system is
installed.</p>

<p>The system also stores the information required to let players log in to the
system, and what level of access each player has.</p>

<p>Although the system stores each players' email address and full name, this
information is only visible to people with speciall access rights. In the
publicly visible pages, it only shows a player's firstname and last initial, along
with which part they play.</p>


<h2>Events</h2>

<p>An event has a name, description, venue, start and end time (and date).</p>

<p>The list of events can be mananged by users with an appropriate access level.
There are facilities for exporting the list of events so they can be imported
into diary software, and into a MediaWiki page.</p>


<h2>The register</h2>

<p>The register lists events across the top, and players down the side. In each
cell of the register, it shows the players' attendance as one of:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>-</b>: no information has been input yet.</li>
<li><b>No</b>: the player cannot attend</li>
<li><b>Unsure</b>: the player is unsure whether they will be able to attend</li>
<li><b>Yes</b>: the player intends to attend</li>
<li><b>Not needed</b>: the player is not needed for this rehearsal</li>
</ul>
<p>The attendance information is shown nicely colour-coded.</p>


<h2>How users get access to the system</h2>

<p>Anyone who know the right URL can go to the register and see the attendance
information. This is a read-only view that should print nicely.</p>

<p>Players can get access to edit their own information using a special URL with
a token on the end, like ...?t=VDcHOaWWq0XHUwXDD6wJZwzKTqbciiKwoFrToTZ8. Each
player will have a different token, and if they bookmark that URL, then they
can get access to edit their own attendance information.</p>

<p>People with a higher level of access than that have to log in with an email
address and password. There are two classes of people with a higher level of
access: Organisers can edit any player's attendance information, and edit the
list of events and players. Adminsitrators can do anything in the system.</p>
