<h1>An overview of how Orchestra register works</h1>

<p>The basic idea is that you have some of players, and some events like
rehearsals leading up to a concert, and you want to know which players are
planning to be at which events.</p>


<h2>Event series</h2>

<p>Since most orchestras give more than one concert, and the list of players
playing in one concert may be different from those playing in another, the system
can store multiple registers, one for each 'Event series'. An event series has
a name and a description.</p>

<p>An event series also has a list of players and a list of events, which define
the rows and columns in the register.</p>


<h2>Users</h2>

<p>Users are people who have access to the system, regardless of which event series
they are playing in. A user has a first name, last name, and email address. The
system also stores the information required to let players log in to the
system, and what level of access each player has.</p>

<p>Although the system stores each players' email address and full name, this
information is only visible to people with speciall access rights. In the
publicly visible pages, it only shows a player's first name and last initial, along
with which part they play in a particular rehearsal series.</p>


<h2>Players</h2>

<p>The list of players for a rehearsal series says, for each user who is playing
in the series, which part they play.</p>


<h2>Events</h2>

<p>Each event in a series has a name, description, venue, and start and end time (and date).</p>

<p>There are facilities for exporting the list of events so they can be imported
into diary software, and into a MediaWiki page.</p>


<h2>The register</h2>

<p>For a given event series, the register lists events across the top,
and players down the side. In each cell of the register, it shows the players'
attendance as one of:</p>
<ul>
<li><b></b>: (that is, blank) no information has been input yet.</li>
<li><b>No</b>: the player cannot attend</li>
<li><b>?</b>: the player is unsure whether they will be able to attend</li>
<li><b>Yes</b>: the player intends to attend</li>
<li><b>-</b>: the player is not needed for this rehearsal</li>
</ul>
<p>The attendance information is shown nicely colour-coded.</p>


<h2>How users get access to the system</h2>

<p>Anyone who know the right URL can go to the register and see the attendance
information. This is a read-only view.</p>

<p>Each user has a special URL with
a token on the end, like ...?t=VDcHOaWWq0XHUwXDD6wJZwzKTqbciiKwoFrToTZ8. This
gives that user access to update their own attendance information.</p>

<p>Users with a higher level of access than that have to log in with an email
address and password. There are two classes of people with a higher level of
access, Organisers and Administrators. Adminsitrators can slightly more than
Organisers, but the difference is small. These users can edit any player's
attendance, and can edit the list of users, players, events and event series.</p>
