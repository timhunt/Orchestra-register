<h1>Roadmap</h1>

<p>This list of planned changes is aspirational and indicative, rather than
a list of promises.</p>

<h2>To do for version 3.0</h2>

<ul>
<li>Fix any bugs found during beta testing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ideas that may be implemented sooner rather than later</h2>

<ul>
<li>And option to only print some columns on the register - otherwise it does not
fit on the page early in a series of rehearsals when there are many events.</li>
<li>Clean up the list of users, so that disabled user accounts do not clutter up the
main list, but can still be accessed in case you need to bring someone back.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ideas that may be implemented in the future</h2>

<ul>
<li>AJAX saving of status</li>
<li>Email for players to recover their own URL</li>
<li>UI to change a player's token</li>
<li>Try to find a work-around to the Firefox cursor keys navigation bug</li>
<li>Support other databases</li>
<li>Allow text to be translated</li>
<li>Allow integration with other authentication systems, for example the OU's single-sign-on system.</li>
<li>Sort out long-term data-retention. For example, a way to clean up old logs,
to completely delete old rehearsal series, to permanently delete users who have really gone.</li>
</ul>
