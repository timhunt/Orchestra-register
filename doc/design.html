<h1>Orchestra register system design</h1>


<h2>Overall architecture</h2>

<p>There is a three-layer architecture.</p>

<p>The database layer is in the files <tt>lib/database.php</tt>,
<tt>lib/database_connection.php</tt>, <tt>lib/transaction.php</tt> and
<tt>lib/installer.php</tt>.</p>

<p>The domain layer made up of all the other classes in the lib folder, that are
not otherwise mentioned here. That contains the system class
<tt>orchestra_register</tt>, which acts as a facade to the rest of the domain classes.
Then there is a class for each significant database table (<tt>series</tt>,
<tt>event</tt>, <tt>player</tt>, <tt>user</tt>, <tt>attendance</tt>).
Then there are some classes that hold the configuration (<tt>version</tt>,
<tt>sys_config</tt> and <tt>db_config</tt>).</p>

<p>The user interface layer adopts a transaction script architecture, with the
scripts living in the top-level folder. To avoid duplicated code, there are
helper classes <tt>html_output</tt> in <tt>lib/html_output.php</tt>, and a set
of classes for representing forms in <tt>lib/forms.php</tt>.</p>

<p>If you like to think of web applications according to the Model-View-Controller
paradigm, note that there is a point in each transaction script where all the
code before that point can be viewed as controller code, and all the code after
that point can be viewed as view code. The domain layer provides the model.</p>

<h2>More on the UI scripts</h2>

<p>The UI scripts can be roughly split into several categories:</p>

<p>Scripts that are basically just a view. For example, <tt>index.php</tt>,
<tt>event.php</tt>, <tt>player.php</tt>, <tt>logs.php</tt>,
<tt>wikiformat.php</tt> and <tt>ical.php</tt>.</p>

<p>Scripts that display a list of things, with some facilities for editing them.
For example <tt>events.php</tt>, <tt>series.php</tt>, <tt>users.php</tt>.</p>

<p>Scripts that use a form to edit something. For example <tt>editevent.php</tt>,
<tt>editpart.php</tt>, <tt>editsection.php</tt>, <tt>editseries.php</tt>,
<tt>edituser.php</tt>, <tt>editmotd.php</tt> and <tt>admin.php</tt>,
although the last two are slightly different.</p>

<p>The scripts <tt>login.php</tt> and <tt>logout.php</tt> handle authenticating users.</p>

<p>The remaining others: <tt>savechoices.php</tt> which process the Save changes
submission from <tt>index.php</tt>; <tt>players.php</tt> for editing the list
of players for a rehearsal series; <tt>extractemails.php</tt> for getting a list
of email addresses based on the register data; and <tt>install.php</tt> deals
with installing the software initially.</p>

<p>Note that the files <tt>config.php</tt> and <tt>version.php</tt> (and
<tt>config-example.php</tt>) in the top-level folder are configuration files.
<tt>script.js</tt> and <tt>styles.css</tt> (and <tt>styles-extra.css</tt>, if
you use it) are part of the UI, and used on every page. <tt>setup.php</tt> is
the file that all the scripts need to include to get access to the standard
libraries.</p>
