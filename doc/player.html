<h1>How to user Orchestra register as a player</h1>

<h2>Edit your attendance</h2>

<p>You should have been given a special link to use for editing your attendance.
The link will end with something like <tt>...?t=VDcHOaWWq0XHUwXDD6wJZwzKTqbciiKwoFrToTZ8</tt>,
that is, with a string of 40 seemingly random characters. You need to use this link
every time you want to edit your attendance, so it would be a good idea to bookmark it.</p>

<p>Use the drop-down menus to indicate which rehearsals you will be attending.
Once you have finished making your changes, you need to click the <b>Save changes</b>
button at either the top or bottom of the register.</p>

<p>When you use your special link, for your convenience, your section and part will have
been moved to the top of the register. All the other instruments appear in
a conventional order.</p>

<p>Also note that you may not be required for all rehearsals. You will not be
able to incicate your attendace at those rehearsals. Instead, of a dropdown
menu you will see a '-'.</p>

<p>As a shortcut, you can use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move around the register.
(This does not work in Firefox.)</p>


<h2>Download the rehearsal list</h2>

<p>Underneath the register there is a link <b>Download iCal file (to add the
rehearsals into Outlook, etc.)</b>. If you click that link, then a file will download.
You can import that file into Oulook, Google calendar, iCal, and many other types
of calendar software. This will automatically set up information about all the
rehearsals in your diary.</p>

<p>Note, that to make this work with Outlook, it seems you must first save the
<tt>orchestra.ics</tt> file on your desktop, then go to <b>File</b>,
<b>Import and export ...</b> in Outlook to Import it as an .vcs file. If you just
open the file with Outlook, then it will only import the first rehearsal. Any
other calendar program just seems to work without complications.</p>

<p>If, later, the times of any rehearsals are changed, you can click the link
again, and the rehearsal information that is already in your diary should
be updated automatically.</p>


<h2>Print view</h2>

<p>There is a link at the bottom for getting the register in a format suitable
for printing. This is most useful for organisers, but it is available for
everyone.</p>


<h2>Show past rehearsals</h2>

<p>Normally, the register only shows the events that are still in the future.
If you want to see the information about past rehearsals, then there is a link
underneath the register to do that.</p>


<h2>Other series of rehearsals</h2>

<p>There may be several different series of rehearsals (for example, rehearsals
leading up to the spring concert, and rehearsals leading up to the summer concert).
If that is the case, there will be a row of link underneath the register to let
you switch between them.</p>


<h2>If you have any problems</h2>

<p>For example, if you forget your special link, or cannot use the system, then
look at the small text at the bottom of the screen. There may be a <b>Get help</b>
link there, if the administrator has set one up.</p>
