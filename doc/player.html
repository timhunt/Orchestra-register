<h1>How to user Orchestra register as a player</h1>

<h2>Edit your attendance</h2>

<p>You should have been given a special link to use for editing your attendance.
The link will end with something like <tt>...?t=VDcHOaWWq0XHUwXDD6wJZwzKTqbciiKwoFrToTZ8</tt>,
that is, with a string of 40 seemingly random characters. You need to use this link
every time you want to edit your attendance, so it would be a good idea to bookmark it.</p>

<p>Use the drop-down menus to indicate which rehearsals you will be attending.
Once you have finished making your changes, you need to click the <b>Save changes</b>
button at either the top or bottom of the register.</p>

<p>Note that when you use your special link, your section and part will have
been moved to the top of the register, while all the other instruments appear in
a conventional order.</p>

<p>Also note that you may not be required for all rehearsals. You will not be
able to incicate your attendace at those rehearsals. Instead, of a dropdown
menu you will see the message 'Not needed'.</p>


<h2>Download the rehearsal list</h2>

<p>Underneath the register there is a link <b>Download iCal file (to add the
rehearsals into Outlook, etc.)</b>. If you click that link, then a file will download.
You can import that file into Oulook, Google calendar, iCal, and many other types
of calendar software. This will automatically set up information about all the
rehearsals in your diary.</p>

<p>If, later, the times of any rehearsals are changed, you can click the link
again, and the rehearsal information that is already in your diary should
be updated automatically.</p>


<h2>Show past rehearsals</h2>

<p>Normally, the register only shows the events that are still in the future.
If you want to see the information about past rehearsals, then there is a link
underneath the register to do that.</p>


<h2>If you have any problems</h2>

<p>For example, if you forget your special link, or cannot use the system, then
look at the small text at the bottom of the screen. There should be a message
there telling you how to ask for help.</p>
