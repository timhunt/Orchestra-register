<h1>About orchestra register</h1>

<p>Orchestra register was created by Tim Hunt starting in November 2009 to meet
the needs of the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">Open Universitry</a>
<a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/wikis/ouocmc/OU_Orchestra">orchestra</a>. It is
a web application that needs to be <a href="installing.html">installed</a> on a
server with PHP 5+ and MySQL 5+.</p>

<p>Orchestra register is developed at
<a href="http://github.com/timhunt/Orchestra-register">http://github.com/timhunt/Orchestra-register</a>.
You are encouraged to help be submitting enhancements and bug fixes. Before
starting work on major changes, it would probably be a good idea to discuss them
with Tim.</p>

<p>To avoid any doubt, this is a personal project of Tim Hunt, who just happens
to play in the OU Orchestra, and work at the OU. The Open University is not
in any way liable for anything this software does.</p>
