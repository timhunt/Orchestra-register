<h1>How to install Orchestra register</h1>

<p>These instructions should mostly seem fairly familiar if you have ever
installed a web application written in PHP before.</p>


<h2>System requirements</h2>

<p>Orchestra register needs to be installed on a web server that can execute PHP
code, and that can connect to a MySQL database. As far as I am aware, it does
not require any special PHP modules. The minimum required versions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>PHP version 5 or greater (tested on PHP 5.2.x).</li>
<li>MySQL 5 or greater (tested on MySQL 5.1.x). Orchestra register uses only InnoDB tables.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm afraid those requirements are currently rather vague. If you discover that
Orchestra register does, or does not, work with particular versions of PHP or MySQL,
it would be helpful if you could let us know.</p>


<h2>Creating a database</h2>

<p>you need to <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/database-use.html">create
a database</a> for Orchestra register to store its data in. Below I will assume that
the database is called <tt>registerdb</tt>.</p>

<p>I would also recommend that you
<a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/user-account-management.html"></a>create
a database user that is only allowed to access that database. Whichever user
account you plan to use to let the Orchestra register system connect to the
database needs to have all privileges (except for GRANT OPTION) over that database.
In what follows I will assume you are connecting to the database using username
<tt>registeruser</tt> with password <tt>secret!</tt>.</p>


<h2>Getting the code</h2>

<p>You need to download all the Orchestra register code, and put it somewhere
where your web server can execute it. For example, in a typical Apache install,
you might put the code in <tt>/var/www/register</tt>.</p>

<p>How you do that is up to you. You could download a zip file of the code, uncompress
it, and then upload it using FTP. Alternatively, you could use a command like</p>
<pre>git clone git://github.com/timhunt/Orchestra-register.git register</pre>
<p>from the command line in <tt>/var/www</tt>. The latter method would make
it easier to update to future releases when the time comes.</p>


<h2>Create config.php</h2>

<p>In the place where you put the the Orchestra register code, you need to
create a file called config.php that contains the information needed to
connect to the database, and a couple of other values.</p>

<p>The easiest way to create config.php is to edit make a copy of the example
file config-example.php, and then edit that copy. You need to fill in the
database information, the URL that points to this instance of
Orchestra register, and a 'password salt'.</p>

<p>Password salt is used for extra security when storing passwords in the database.
You should set it to a 40-character random value. There are useful online scripts
that can help you generate such a value, for example <a href="http://dev.moodle.org/gensalt.php">This
one provided by the Moodle project</a>.</p>

<p>Using the example values from above, a config.php file would look something like:</p>
<pre>
&lt;?php

$config-&gt;dbhost = 'localhost';
$config-&gt;dbuser = 'registeruser';
$config-&gt;dbpass = 'secret!';
$config-&gt;dbname = 'registerdb';

$config-&gt;wwwroot = 'http://example.com/register/';

$config-&gt;pwsalt = 'J1sb132ZkIouCNPEAek95ZRDuEUZy9ofIp65U15W';
</pre>


<h2>Prepare some initial data</h2>

<p>When Orchestra register installs itself, there the option to automatically
load the list of sections, parts, players and events. To do this you need to
edit the files in the <tt>data</tt> folder. There is a reasonable default
set of parts and sections already set up. If you want to automatically create
players or events, you will need to start with a copy of <tt>users-example.txt</tt>
renamed to <tt>users.txt</tt> (or a copy of <tt>events-example.txt</tt> renamed
to <tt>events.txt</tt>).</p>

<p>Actually, for now, it is pretty essential that you create <tt>users.txt</tt> file
with at least one user in it. When Orchestra register installs itself, the
first user is given administrator access, with the password <b>mozart</b>, and this
is the only way to create the first administrator account.</p>


<h2>Allow Orchestra register to install itself</h2>

<p>Now everything is ready, so you just need to go the the URL where you put
Orchestra register (<tt>http://example.com/register/</tt> in the example above).
Orchestra register will automatically install itself. That is, it will
create the necessary database tables, and populate some of them with data.</p>

<p>Once the installation is complete, you will see the register screen with all
the attendance information blank. The system is now ready for use.</p>

<p>During the installation, the first player in the <tt>data/users.txt</tt>
file is made an administrator, with the password <b>mozart</b>. You are strongly
advised to change that password as soon as possible. You can do that by logging
in as that user and going to the edit users page.</p>


<h2>Customising the appearance</h2>

<p>If you want to adjust how Orchestra register looks, you can create a new
CSS file <tt>styles-extra.css</tt> in the same folder as <tt>styles.css</tt>.
This will then be linked ot as well as styles.css, and you can put your own
style rules in there.</p>
