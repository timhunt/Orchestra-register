<h1>Orchestra register release notes</h1>

<h2>What's new in Version 3.0</h2>

<p>The main new feature are a set of new pages, one for each player, and one
for each event, displaying the information about those thigns in a way that
should work well on mobile devices.</p>

<p>There is now much better navigation between all the different screens, which
should require fewer trips back to the main register page in order to get to
where you want.</p>

<p>Other minor changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is now a page for editing the list of sections and parts.</li>
<li>People who can access the user list get a mailto link to remind people of their magic URL.</li>
<li>The magic URLs are now also shown on the edit players page.</li>
<li>Logged in users can change their own password.</li>
<li>The process for installing a new copy of Orchestra register is now greatly imporved.</li>
<li>The code has also been reorganised a bit. Some scripts have been renamed with clearer names,
and the library classes have been split up into one class per file.</li>
</ul>


<h2>What's new in Version 2.0</h2>

<p>The big new feature is support for more than one series of events. This
included separating the concept of user from the concept of player. When working
with the system, there is always the concept of the current event series, which
can be switched using the links underneath the main register.</p>

<p>A smaller new feature is the ability to get a list of email addresses based
on the information in the register. For example, you can get a list of all
string players who have not yet said whether they will be able to come to the next
rehearsal. Naturally, only users with appropriate permissions can access this.</p>

<p>The sort order has been changed to order by firstname, then lastname, rather
than ordering by lastname then firstname. That is what the OU orchestra wanted,
and it seems more friendly.</p>

<p>Finally, there is a new admin setting. You can give a prefix that is added
in front of the name of every event when exporting as iCal. This is so that you
can have nice short event names like 'Rehearsal' or 'Concert' in the register,
but more comprehensible names like 'Milton Keynes Orchestra Rehearsal' in the
export file.</p>
