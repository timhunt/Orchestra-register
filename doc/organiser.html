<h1>How to use Orchestra register as an organiser</h1>

<p>Organisers can do <a href="player.html">everything that players can do</a>, and also:</p>


<h2>Log in</h2>

<p>To access Organiser features, you need to log in. Click the <b>log in</b> link at the
top right on the screen, and enter your username and password in the usual sort
of way.</p>


<h2>Edit any players' attendance</h2>

<p>Once you are logged in as an organiser, you will be able to edit any players'
attendance in the register.</p>

<p>In addition, you will get an extra option in each dropdown menu that lets you
indicate that a player is not required for a particular rehearsal.</p>


<h2>Edit the list of players</h2>

<p>Underneath the register, you will get some extra links. Use the
<b>Edit list of players</b> link to edit the list of players(!)</p>

<p>That link takes you to a list of players. One thing to note about this list is
that it gives the special link (URL) for each player. You can use this list if
a player has forgotten their special URL and asks you for it again.</p>

<p>Next to each player, there is an <b>Edit</b> link to edit that players' details.</p>

<p>There is also a <b>Delete</b> button for each player. If you click it, the
player is not completely deleted from the database. Instead they are just hidden.
Hidden players have an <b>Un-delete</b> button which lets you get them back.</p>

<p>Top and bottom of the list of players are <b>Add another player</b> and
<b>Back to the register</b> links.</p>


<h2>Edit the list of events</h2>

<p>Works just like the edit players interface, but with the obvious differences.</p>


<h2>Set some introductory text</h2>

<p>Using the <b>Edit introductory message</b> link, you can set a message, with an
optional heading, to appear above the register. The message uses
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">MarkDown</a> format
to allow basic formatting in the message.</p>


<h2>Get the list of events in MediaWiki format</h2>

<p>Under the register you will also see a link <b>List of events to copy-and-paste
into the wiki</b>. That takes you to a page that formats the list of events in a
format suitable for copying and pasting into a MediaWiki site.</p>

<p>If the an administrator has set it up, there will also be a link that takes
you directly to the editing page where you need to paste the list.</p>
