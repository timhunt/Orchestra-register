<h1>How to use Orchestra register as an organiser</h1>

<p>Organisers can do <a href="player.html">everything that players can do</a>, and also:</p>


<h2>Log in</h2>

<p>To access Organiser features, you need to log in. Click the <b>log in</b> link at the
top right on the screen, and enter your username and password in the usual sort
of way.</p>


<h2>Edit any players' attendance</h2>

<p>Once you are logged in as an organiser, you will be able to edit any players'
attendance in the register.</p>

<p>In addition, you will get an extra option in each dropdown menu that lets you
indicate that a player is not required for a particular rehearsal.</p>


<h2>Edit the list of players</h2>

<p>Underneath the register, you will get some extra links. Use the
<b>Edit list of players</b> link to edit the list of players(!)</p>

<p>That lists all the players and the part they are currently playing. At the
bottom of the list are the users who are currently not playing. If you change
the values in the drop-down menus, and then click 'Save cahnges', you can change
so is, or is not, playing, and which parts they are playing.</p>


<h2>Edit the list of users</h2>

<p>Someone can only be made a player for a particular event if they have
been entered into the system as a user. To do that, use the <b>Edit the list of users</b>
link. That takes you to the list of users. One thing to note about this list is
that it gives the special link (URL) for each player. You can use this list if
a player has forgotten their special URL and asks you for it again.</p>

<p>Next to each user, there is an <b>Edit</b> link to edit that user's details.</p>

<p>Top and bottom of the list of players are <b>Add another user</b> and
<b>Back to the register</b> links.</p>


<h2>Edit the list of event series</h2>

<p>This is accessed using the <b>Edit the list of rehearsal series</b> link.
It works very like the Edit the list of users page, but there are two special
things to note.</p>

<p>Next to each rehearsal series (except the current one) there is an <b>Archive</b>
button. This lets you effectively hide old series of rehearsals, without losing
that date about who came to each rehearsal. A series that has been archived can
be brough back using the <b>Restore</b> button.</p>

<p>When you create a new series, you can choose to set up the list of players from
the list for another series. This can save a lot of time if the list of players is
similar. It is quicker to copy the old list and then edit it a bit, rather than
having to set up the list of players from scratch.</p>


<h2>Edit the list of events</h2>

<p>Works just like the edit event series interface, but with the obvious differences.</p>


<h2>Edit the list of sections and parts</h2>

<p>You can add new sections or parts using the <b>Edit the available sections and parts</b>
link underneath the register. You can also change the order in which they are displayed.
You can only delete a Section or Part if there are no players of that part in any
rehearsal series, even archived ones.</p>


<h2>Set some introductory text</h2>

<p>Using the <b>Edit introductory message</b> link, you can set a message, with an
optional heading, to appear above the register. The message uses
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">MarkDown</a> format
to allow basic formatting in the message.</p>


<h2>Get lists of email addresses</h2>

<p>Suppose (by way of example) you would like to get the email addresses of all
Brass players who are not coming to the next rehearsal. You can do this using the
<b>Get a list of email addresses</b> link. On this page, you can choose one or
more parts (CTFL + click to select muliple parts), and optionally, you can choose
an event and a list of attendance statuses, then click <b>Get email addresses</b>,
and you will get a list of the email addresses of all the people you asked for,
in a format suitable for copying and pasting into your email program.</p>


<h2>Get the list of events in MediaWiki format</h2>

<p>Under the register you will also see a link <b>List of events to copy-and-paste
into the wiki</b>. That takes you to a page that formats the list of events in a
format suitable for copying and pasting into a MediaWiki site.</p>

<p>If the an administrator has set it up, there will also be a link that takes
you directly to the editing page where you need to paste the list.</p>
