<h1>How to use Orchestra register as an administrator</h1>

<p>Administrators can do <a href="organiser.html">everything that organisers
can do</a> with the following additions.</p>

<ul>
<li>They can create passwords to let other players log in, using the edit player form.</li>
<li>They can grant administrator or organiser permissions to other users, using the edit player form.</li>
<li>They can edit the system configuration settings.</li>
<li>All actions that change data in the database are logged, as are log ins, log outs and failed login attempts. Administrators can see the logs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: you cannot change your own role. This prevents the accident where you are
the only adminsitrator, and you remove your own administrator permissions, and then
you are stuck with no way to get them back. If you want to stop being an adminstrator,
you have to find someone else to be administrator, and then they can change your
permissions for you.</p>
